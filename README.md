Nanoweather weather forecast app

Nanoweather is a weather app build with React, Typescript, and Sass. It shows real-time weather and weekly forecast based on user location coordinates, while the background changes depending on the daytime. You can also search for the current weather information by city.

This project uses Typescript for all its components, Sass library to style the app and pass variables across the Scss modules. I used Axios for fetching data from OpenWeather API.
